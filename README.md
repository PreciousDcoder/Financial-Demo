# Financial-Demo Project
A complete data analysis project on a financial dataset from Kaggle

# Project Overview
This is a complete data analysis project on a financial dataset downloaded from Kaggle. This dataset was thoroughly and analyzed to discover the products and countries with the highest productivity. This company performs businesses in different countries and they have different products and segment. This project was helped the company to know its most profitable segments, products, and country. 

 # Dataset

 This dataset was downloaded from Kaggle after performing thorough research to ensure that the dataset is of good quality and represents a real-life business activities. 

# Libraries: 

This project was performed using Python. Several Python libraries were used, such as;
1. Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
2. Missigno for understanding the pattern of missingness of the dataset
3. Pandas
4. Numpy

# Data Analysis (Interesting codes I worked with)
.strip(): I made use of .strip() to eliminate whitespaces from my dataset/columns
.corr: I used this to check the level of relationship or correlation between two variables in my dataset. 


# Steps

1. importing of necessary libraries like numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, missingno, etc.
2. Data investigation: Understand the shape of the dataset, and analyzing the columns
3. Data cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, dropping columns, extraction of categorical and numerical columns
4. Exploratory data analysis: Univariate, Analysis, Bivariate Analysis, and Multivariate

# Diagrams used for Analysis

1. Bar chart
2. Histogram
3. Heatmap
4. Scatterplot
5. Missingino
6. Lineplot
7. pairplot


# Exploratory Data Analysis Findings

1. The product with the highest profit
2. The segment of the company with the highest profit
3. The product with the highest sales
4. The relationship between cost of goods sold and profit
5. The country with the highest sales
6. The country with the highest sales
7. The country with the highest profit
8. The product with the highest cost of goods sold(COGS)

# Recommendation

1. Increasing supply to Canada appears to be a strategic move to capitalize on the strong demand
2. The company's operations in the United States appears to be very successful, generating the highest profit. The company should increase its supply to the United States and also implement similar strategies in other markets with high potential. Analyzing the factors contributing to the success of the market in the United States can provide valuable insights for improving performance in other regions.

# Limitations

I had to remove whitespaces from my columns which posed as a challenge at the beginning because I was unable to take note of this earlier, which made it impossible for my columns to be callable.
